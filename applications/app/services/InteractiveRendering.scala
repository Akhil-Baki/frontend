  This object was introduced in late 2020, to handle the routing between regular rendering of interactives
  versus the code that had been written to handle the US Presidential Election Tracker amp page.

  The tracker (an ng-interactive) didn't have a AMP page and there were two ways to provide one to it.
  1. Implement the support for it in DCR, or
  2. Implement support for it directly in the [applications] app, using the AMP page already present in CAPI.

  The former would have taken too long so we went for the latter.

  We are now moving towards supporting interactives in DCR ðŸ™‚
